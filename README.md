### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I'm Megha, a software engineer based in Berlin, Germany.

I enjoy creating seamless digital experiences and am passionate about combining my technical skills with design to bring ideas to life through code. Here, I share some of the things I'm building and learning along the way.

### Fun Facts:

- â˜• I'm one of the many who can't resist a good coffee.
- ðŸŒ² When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll often find me outdoors exploring nature.
